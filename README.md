# Hi there üëã, my name is Enjae Antonio

I am 21 years old, I was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and I'm currently on my journey to become a full-stack developer at MITT. As a Student Developer, I embrace the learning process and welcome any feedback on my projects to help me improve. Feel free to check them out and let me know your thoughts.

# Projects

Here are some of the projects I have done at MITT

## Code First Music System
This project is a full-stack Spotify-like application that was built using the code-first approach. The application allows users to search for and listen to music, and create playlists. I worked on implementing the database models, creating CRUD functionality for the database, and building the UI using ASP.NET MVC and Razor Pages.

## Mock Social Media Platform
This project is a front-end webpage that mimics a social media platform where users can create posts containing text or image content and displays the posts on the webpage. I worked on designing the user interface and implementing the functionality to allow users to create and delete posts.
