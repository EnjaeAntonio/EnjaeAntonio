# Favourite Projects

## Code First Music System

This project is a full-stack Spotify-like application that was built using the code-first approach. The application allows users to search for and listen to music, and create playlists. I worked on implementing the database models, creating CRUD functionality for the database, and building the UI using ASP.NET MVC and Razor Pages.
