### Hi there 👋, my name is Enjae Antonio

I was born in Winnipeg Manitoba, and I am currently on the path to becoming a full-stack developer at MITT. My current languages are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy developing websites and having everything come together and work! 

I am a fairly new programmer and so far I am enjoying the struggle of learning new languages. Feel free to checkout my projects and provide some feedback to let me know on which areas I can improve on. Otherwise keep scrolling!
